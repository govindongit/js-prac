 let button = document.getElementById('dialog-close-button'); */

//  Delay JavaScript Loading: The defer attribute specifies that the script should be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.
// placing script at the end:
{/* <html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="user-greeting">Welcome back, user</div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="my-script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
// using defer:
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" defer></script> */}


// Get rid of unnecessary loops and calls made inside loops.
// Array push() pop() and shift() instructions have minimal processing overhead due to being language constructs closely related to their low-level assembly language counterparts.
